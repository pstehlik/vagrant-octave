# Base octave install install

## Installation instructions OS-X

[Install brew](http://brew.sh/) `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
[Install cask](http://caskroom.io/) `brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask`
Install xquartz by running `brew cask install xquartz`
Install virtualbox `brew cask install virtualbox`
Install vagrant `brew cask install vagrant`

If you like ease of management of your vagrant boxes
`brew cask install vagrant-manager`

There were reports of having to run X11 before being able to use the X11 forwarding that is used to forward the display of the host to the vagrant machine.

## Running on OS-X

Run the vagrant machine `vagrant up`
Enter the machine `vagrant ssh`
Run Octave via `octave` or `octave --force-gui` 
Graph some stuff in Octave `sombrero(42)`

If you can't run octave because of missing config for X11 forwarding 
run `vagrant ssh-config` and add it to your `~/.ssh/config`.
It should look something like

```
Host vagrant
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 2222
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /Users/pstehlik/coding/vagrant/vagrant-opencv/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL
  ForwardX11 yes
```
